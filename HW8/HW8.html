<h1>Homework 8 </h1>
<h2> This map shows Louisiana's Major Urban Areas in relation to its waterways. The urban areas have two buffers, a 1 kilometer buffer and a 5 kilometer buffer, that can show the potential impact that runoff from these urban areas can have on these waterways from just day to day pollution or major storm events.  </h2>

    <h2> In order to answer my question of how runoff from urban areas might affect Louisiana waterways, I had to create two buffers, one for a fairly typical day (1 km) and one that might represent a major storm event that would increase runoff (5 km). I also altered the transparency of each of urban area layers (original and buffer) so you can see how they compare to one another. I also had to change the projection of the original files to 3451, a Louisiana state projection. </h2>
